So, you work at an ISP and you need a RADIUS server for your billing. If you want

- to have predictable performance and memory usage
- no crashes in the middle of the day, and
- no cramming in your vendor logic into existing solutions

..then why not code your own?
Semicircle gives you the right tools to do just that.
