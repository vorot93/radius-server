So, you work at an ISP and you need a RADIUS server for your billing. If you want

* to have predictable performance and memory usage
* no crashes in the middle of the day, and
* no cramming in your vendor logic into existing solutions

..then why not code your own?
Semicircle gives you the right tools to do just that.
